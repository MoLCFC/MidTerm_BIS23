    <h1>AI Tool Reflection</h1>

    <h3>Which AI tool(s) did you use?</h3>
    <p>I used ChatGPT by OpenAI to assist with generating and modifying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for my portfolio project.</p>

    <h3>How did it help you?</h3>
    <p>ChatGPT helped me plan page sections, generate responsive layouts, debug JavaScript, and save time formatting content. It also helped ensure I followed web development best practices.</p>

    <h3>What challenges did you encounter?</h3>
    <p>The biggest challenge was making sure AI-generated code didn't conflict with my existing code. I had to carefully integrate new sections while preserving features already built.</p>

    <h3>What did you learn overall about using AI for coding?</h3>
    <p>I learned that AI can speed up development and offer valuable suggestions, but it still requires human oversight. It's a great assistant, not a replacement. You must understand your own project to integrate AI effectively.</p>
